1:Set up your React project
2:Set up Webpack
3:Set up Babel
4:Set up S3 deployment
5:Enable CORS
6:Create a build script 
 


Since Webflow doesn’t allow you to host your own script files on their servers, we’ll have to load the script from an external server. For this, we’ll use Amazon S3.


Create an S3 CLI User

  create a user for the AWS CLI to use:

    In the AWS dashboard, go to Services > IAM > Users
    Add a user and give it a name
    Check Programmatic access > Next
    Attach existing policies > check AmazonS3FullAccess
    Click Next > Next > Create
    Keep this page open and open a terminal
    Type in aws configure
    Enter your access key ID and secret access key as prompted

Create a build script

To bundle an app using Webpack, you only have to use the “webpack” command, so go ahead and add the following script to your package.json:

"build": "webpack",
Create a deploy script

Add the following script to your package.json, making sure to replace BUCKETNAME with the name of your s3 bucket:

"deploy": "aws s3 cp ./dist/bundle.js s3://BUCKETNAME/ --acl public-read"
